* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   game/Madd_M_currentPlayer_q[1]_GND_6_o_add_88_OUT_cy[1] is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
